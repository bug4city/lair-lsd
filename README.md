# Lair Finance: Decentralized Kaia Liquid Staking

![Lair Finance](images/lair-lsd.png)

Welcome to Lair Finance. Lair is the first decentralized liquid staking derivative service on the Kaia network, built on the premise of [**KIP-163: CnStakingV3**](https://docs.kaia.io/learn/governance/governance-by-kip/#kip-163-cnstakingv3-with-public-delegation-), providing a simple way and diverse options to get rewards with KAIA token.

## Features

1. **NodeController**: Protocol to manage deposits, staking rewards, and withdrawals.

2. **StakingToken**: Unlike staked tokens, the Lair `[stKAIA]` tokens are freely transferable instead of locked as in the case of native staking. Lair lets users operate with staked tokens by leveraging collateral, lending, farming, and other kinds of DeFi protocols. It’s a yield-bearing token whose value against KAIA systematically increases over time.

3. **DAO**: Lair Finance management entity, responsible for picking GCs, configuring the protocol parameters and much more. It will be managed by Lair DAO token holder governance.

4. **GC Partners**: GCs that manage a secure and stable infrastructure for running validator clients for the benefit of the Lair Finance and its users. They’re dedicated staking providers who can ensure the safety of funds belonging to the protocol users and correctness of validator operations.

5. **Public Delegation**: Before `CnStakingV3`, only a few validators offered public delegation services, limiting users' options. By enabling public delegation natively in `CnStakingV3`, users can delegate their KAIA to any validator offering this service, thus broadening the delegation options and improving network participation. Lair Finance is the first service to adopt KIP-163: `CnStakingV3` on Kaia, allowing users to delegate their KAIA tokens to a decentralized set of GC members.
